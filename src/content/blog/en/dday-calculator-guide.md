## Understanding Date Calculations

Date calculations help you track deadlines, plan events, and mark milestones. Whether counting down to a vacation or up from a relationship anniversary, precise date math matters.

## Types of Date Calculations

### Days Until (Countdown)
How many days remain until a future date.

### Days Since
How many days have passed since a past date.

### Days Between
Total days between any two dates.

## Calculation Methods

### Simple Day Count
Count every day between two dates.

### Business Days
Exclude weekends and optionally holidays.

### Calendar Weeks
Group days into complete weeks plus remaining days.

## D-Day Notation

Military and project management use this system:
- **D-Day**: The target date (D+0)
- **D-1**: One day before
- **D-7**: One week before
- **D+1**: One day after
- **D+30**: One month after
