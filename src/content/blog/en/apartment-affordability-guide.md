## Determining Your Home Budget

Buying a home is a major financial decision. Knowing how much you can truly afford prevents overextending yourself and ensures comfortable monthly payments.

## The 28/36 Rule

Financial experts recommend:
- **28% rule**: Housing costs ≤ 28% of gross monthly income
- **36% rule**: Total debt ≤ 36% of gross monthly income

### Example

Gross monthly income: $8,000
- Max housing payment: $8,000 × 28% = $2,240
- Max total debt: $8,000 × 36% = $2,880

## Key Affordability Factors

### 1. Gross Income
Your total earnings before taxes and deductions.

### 2. Down Payment
Larger down payments mean:
- Lower monthly payments
- No PMI (at 20%+)
- Better interest rates

### 3. Existing Debts
Monthly obligations that reduce buying power:
- Car payments
- Student loans
- Credit card minimums
- Other loans

### 4. Credit Score
Higher scores qualify for better rates:
- 740+: Best rates
- 700-739: Good rates
- 660-699: Fair rates
- Below 660: Limited options

## Hidden Costs to Consider

Beyond the purchase price, budget for:
- **Closing costs**: 2-5% of home price
- **Property taxes**: Varies by location
- **Homeowners insurance**: $1,000-3,000/year
- **HOA fees**: If applicable
- **Maintenance**: 1-2% of home value annually
- **Utilities**: Often higher than renting

## Income-to-Home Price Guidelines

| Annual Income | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|--------------|--------------|----------|------------|
| $75,000 | $225,000 | $300,000 | $375,000 |
| $100,000 | $300,000 | $400,000 | $500,000 |
| $150,000 | $450,000 | $600,000 | $750,000 |
