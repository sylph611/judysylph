## Understanding Unemployment Benefits

Unemployment insurance (UI) provides temporary financial assistance to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. It's designed to help cover basic expenses while you search for new employment.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for unemployment benefits, you typically must:

- **Have sufficient work history**: Meet minimum earnings or hours during the base period
- **Be unemployed through no fault**: Layoffs qualify; quitting or being fired for cause typically don't
- **Be able and available to work**: Ready to accept suitable job offers
- **Actively seek employment**: Document job search activities

### Base Period

Usually the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before filing your claim.

## Benefit Calculation

**Weekly Benefit = Base Period Earnings × Benefit Percentage**

### State Variations

| State Example | Max Weekly Benefit | Replacement Rate |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| California | ~$450 | ~60-70% |
| New York | ~$504 | ~50% |
| Massachusetts | ~$1,015 | ~57% |
| Texas | ~$563 | ~47% |

## Duration of Benefits

- **Standard**: 26 weeks (most states)
- **Some states**: 12-20 weeks
- **Extended**: Additional weeks during high unemployment periods

## How to Apply

1. File a claim with your state unemployment office
2. Provide employment history and wage information
3. Complete weekly certifications
4. Report any earnings or job offers

## Tips to Maximize Benefits

- File immediately after losing your job
