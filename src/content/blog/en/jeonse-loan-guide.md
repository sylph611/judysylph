## Understanding Jeonse

Jeonse (전세) is Korea's unique rental system. Instead of paying monthly rent, tenants provide a large refundable deposit—typically 50-80% of the property's value.

## How Jeonse Works

### For Tenants
1. Pay large deposit (Jeonse money)
2. Live rent-free during lease (typically 2 years)
3. Receive full deposit back when lease ends

### For Landlords
- Invest deposit money for returns
- No monthly rental income
- Must return deposit at lease end

## Jeonse Loans Explained

Since deposits are substantial, many renters need financing:

### Loan Types
- **Bank Jeonse loans**: Standard commercial loans
- **Government-backed loans**: Better rates for eligible borrowers
- **Public housing loans**: For specific housing programs

### Typical Terms
- Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Up to 80%
- Interest rates: 3-6%
- Term: Matches lease period (usually 2 years)
- Interest-only payments common

## Eligibility Requirements

### General Requirements
- Korean resident status
- Stable income verification
- Good credit history
- Valid Jeonse contract

### For Government Programs
- Income limits may apply
- First-time renter preferences
- Age restrictions for some programs
- Property value limits

## Example Calculation

Jeonse deposit: ₩300,000,000 (~$230,000)
Loan amount: ₩240,000,000 (80%)
Interest rate: 4%
Monthly payment: ₩800,000 (interest only)

### Your Contribution
- Down payment: ₩60,000,000
- Monthly interest: ₩800,000
- Total 2-year cost: ₩19,200,000

## Jeonse vs Wolse

| Factor | Jeonse | Wolse (Monthly Rent) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Upfront | Very high | Lower deposit |
| Monthly | Interest only (if loan) | Rent payment |
| Return | Full deposit back | Deposit back |
| Risk | Deposit default risk | Rent increases |

## Risks to Consider

### Deposit Return Risk
Landlords may struggle to return deposits if:
- Property values drop
- Financial difficulties
- Jeonse fraud

### Protection Measures
- Jeonse insurance available
- Verify property ownership
- Check existing loans on property
- Use official contracts
