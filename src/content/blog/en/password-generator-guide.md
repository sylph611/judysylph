faq:
  - question: "What makes a password strong?"
    answer: "Length (12+ characters), complexity (mix of character types), randomness (no patterns or dictionary words), and uniqueness (different for each account)."
  - question: "How long should passwords be?"
    answer: "Minimum 12 characters for standard accounts, 16+ for sensitive accounts. Longer passphrases (4+ random words) are even more secure and memorable."
  - question: "Should I use a password manager?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Password managers securely store unique passwords for all accounts, so you only need to remember one master password."

## Why Strong Passwords Matter

Weak passwords are the leading cause of data breaches. A strong, unique password for each account is your first line of defense against hackers.

## Password Strength Factors

### Length
Most important factor. Each character exponentially increases possibilities.

| Length | Time to Crack (Complex) |
|--------|------------------------|
| 8 chars | Hours to days |
| 12 chars | Centuries |
| 16 chars | Millennia |

### Character Types
- Lowercase letters (26)
- Uppercase letters (26)
- Numbers (10)
- Symbols (~32)

Using all types: 94 possible characters per position.

### Randomness
Avoid:
- Dictionary words
- Personal information
- Common patterns (123, qwerty)
- Character substitutions (p@ssw0rd)

## Types of Passwords

### Random Character Passwords
`kX9#mL2$pQ7@nR4`
- Very secure
- Difficult to remember
- Best with password manager

### Passphrases
`correct-horse-battery-staple`
- Multiple random words
- Easier to remember
- Very high entropy with 4+ words

### Pattern-Based (Not Recommended)
`Spring2026!`
- Easy to remember
- Also easy to guess
- Avoid for important accounts

## Password Entropy

Entropy measures password unpredictability in bits:
- 40 bits: Weak
- 60 bits: Moderate
- 80+ bits: Strong
- 100+ bits: Very strong

### Calculation
Entropy = log₂(possible characters^length)

12-character password using 94 characters:
= log₂(94^12) = 78.8 bits (strong)

## Password Best Practices

### Do's
- Use unique password for each account
- Use password manager
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Update passwords if breach occurs
- Use passphrases when possible

### Don'ts
- Reuse passwords
- Share passwords
- Write passwords on sticky notes
- Use personal info (birthdays, names)
- Use common passwords (password123)

## Password Managers

Recommended tools to securely store passwords:
- Generate strong unique passwords
- Auto-fill login forms
- Sync across devices
- Alert about breaches
