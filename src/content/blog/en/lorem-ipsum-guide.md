## What is Lorem Ipsum?

Lorem Ipsum is the standard dummy text used in printing and design since the 1500s. It helps visualize layouts without meaningful content distracting from design elements.

## History of Lorem Ipsum

The text originated from "De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. A printer in the 1500s scrambled it to create a type specimen book. It survived the leap to digital design and remains the industry standard.

## Why Use Placeholder Text?

### Benefits
- **Focus on design**: Content doesn't distract
- **Realistic text flow**: Shows how real content will look
- **Neutral**: Clients don't fixate on draft content
- **Standard**: Universally recognized as placeholder

### Drawbacks
- **Meaningless**: Can't test content readability
- **Latin-based**: Doesn't represent all languages well
- **Over-reliance**: May delay real content creation

## Types of Placeholder Text

### Classic Lorem Ipsum
Traditional scrambled Latin text.

### Themed Alternatives
- **Hipster Ipsum**: Trendy/ironic vocabulary
- **Bacon Ipsum**: Meat-themed filler
- **Cupcake Ipsum**: Sweet treats vocabulary
- **Zombie Ipsum**: Horror-themed text
- **Corporate Ipsum**: Business buzzwords

### Practical Text
- **Real draft content**: Early approximations
- **Content similar to final**: Industry-specific

## How Much Text to Generate

### Common Needs
- Headline: 5-15 words
- Subheading: 10-20 words
- Paragraph: 50-150 words
- Article preview: 25-50 words
- Full article: 300-2000 words

### Responsive Design
Generate varying lengths to test:
- Mobile views (shorter text)
- Tablet views (medium text)
- Desktop views (longer text)

## Standard Lorem Ipsum Text

The traditional opening:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

This text has been the industry standard for centuries.

## Using Lorem Ipsum Properly

### Do

### Don't
