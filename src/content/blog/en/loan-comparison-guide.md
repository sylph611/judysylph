  - question: "What factors should I compare between loans?"
    answer: "Compare APR (not just interest rate), fees, loan term, monthly payment, total cost, and any prepayment penalties."
  - question: "Is a lower monthly payment always better?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Lower payments often mean longer terms, which can result in paying significantly more in total interest."
  - question: "What's the difference between secured and unsecured loans?"
    answer: "Secured loans require collateral (like your car or home) and typically have lower rates. Unsecured loans have no collateral but higher rates."

## Why Compare Loans?

Borrowing money has a cost, and that cost varies dramatically between lenders. A thorough comparison ensures you're not overpaying for credit.

## Key Loan Metrics

### Interest Rate vs APR
- **Interest rate**: Base borrowing cost
- **APR**: Rate + fees = true cost

### Loan Term
Longer terms mean:
- Lower monthly payments
- More total interest paid
- Higher total cost

### Total Cost of Loan
**Total = (Monthly Payment × Months) - Principal**

## Loan Comparison Example

$20,000 personal loan:

| Factor | Lender A | Lender B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Rate | 8.99% | 7.49% |
| Term | 60 months | 48 months |
| Monthly | $414 | $483 |
| Total Interest | $4,868 | $3,187 |
| Total Cost | $24,868 | $23,187 |

Lender B costs $69 more monthly but saves **$1,681** overall.

## Types of Loans

### Personal Loans
- Unsecured (no collateral)
- Fixed rates and terms
- 6-84 month terms typical

### Auto Loans
- Secured by vehicle
- Lower rates than personal loans
- 36-84 month terms

### Home Equity Loans/HELOCs
- Secured by home equity
- Lowest rates available
- Interest may be tax-deductible

### Credit Cards
- Revolving credit
- Highest rates (15-25%+)
- Best for short-term needs

## Where to Get Loans

### Traditional Banks
Established relationships, may offer discounts.

### Credit Unions
Often lower rates, member-owned.

### Online Lenders
Competitive rates, fast approval.

### Peer-to-Peer
Alternative funding, varied rates.

## What to Check Before Accepting

1. **APR**: True borrowing cost
2. **Fees**: Origination, application, etc.
3. **Prepayment penalties**: Cost to pay early
4. **Late fee policy**: Amount and grace period
5. **Customer service**: Reviews and reputation

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Rates significantly above market
- High origination fees (over 5%)
- Mandatory add-on products
- Prepayment penalties
- Pressure tactics
