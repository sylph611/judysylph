## What is Severance Pay?

Severance pay is compensation provided to employees when their employment ends, typically due to layoffs, company restructuring, or termination without cause. It serves as a financial bridge while the employee searches for new employment.

## Who Qualifies for Severance Pay?

Eligibility for severance pay depends on several factors:

- **Employment duration**: Most companies require a minimum tenure
- **Reason for termination**: Usually applicable for layoffs or termination without cause
- **Employment type**: Full-time employees typically qualify; contractors may not
- **Company policy or contract**: Terms may be outlined in your employment agreement

### Important Note

Employees who resign voluntarily or are terminated for cause typically don't receive severance pay.

## Standard Severance Pay Formula

**Severance Pay = Weekly Salary × Years of Service × Multiplier**

### Common Multipliers

- Standard: 1-2 weeks per year of service
- Generous: 3-4 weeks per year of service
- Executive level: May include additional benefits

## Example Calculation

For an employee earning $80,000/year with 5 years of service:

1. Weekly salary: $80,000 ÷ 52 = $1,538
2. Using 2 weeks per year multiplier
3. **Severance: $1,538 × 2 × 5 = $15,380**

## Tax Implications

Severance pay is subject to income tax. Key considerations:

### Lump Sum vs. Installments

- **Lump sum**: Taxed at once, may push you into a higher bracket
- **Installments**: May help manage tax liability

### Potential Deductions

Some severance-related expenses may be tax-deductible, such as job search expenses in certain jurisdictions.

## Negotiating Severance

Don't assume the initial offer is final. Consider negotiating for:

- Extended health insurance coverage
- Outplacement services
- Extended stock vesting
- Positive reference letter
- Non-compete clause modifications
