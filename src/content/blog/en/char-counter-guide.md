faq:
  - question: "Why do character limits matter?"
    answer: "Many platforms have strict limits: Twitter/X (280), SMS (160), meta descriptions (155-160), LinkedIn posts (3000). Exceeding limits truncates your message."
  - question: "What's the difference between characters and bytes?"
    answer: "ASCII characters use 1 byte each. Unicode characters (emojis, non-Latin scripts) may use 2-4 bytes. Some systems count bytes, not characters."
  - question: "Are spaces counted as characters?"
    answer: "Usually yes. \"Hello World\" is 11 characters with the space, 10 without. Some platforms specify \"characters including spaces\" or \"excluding spaces.\""
