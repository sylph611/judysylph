  - question: "What are typical lease terms?"
    answer: "Most leases run 24-36 months with 10,000-15,000 mile annual limits. Exceeding mileage limits costs $0.15-0.30 per mile."

    answer: "Yes! Negotiate the capitalized cost (price), money factor (interest rate), and residual value. Also negotiate dealer fees and acquisition costs."

## The Buy vs Lease Decision

Choosing between buying and leasing affects your finances for years. Understanding the true costs and trade-offs helps you make the right choice.

## Buying: Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **Ownership**: It's yours when paid off
- **No mileage limits**: Drive as much as you want
- **Customization**: Modify as you wish
- **Long-term savings**: No payments after loan ends
- **Equity**: Trade-in value for next car

### Disadvantages
- **Higher monthly payments**: For same car
- **Depreciation risk**: Car loses value
- **Maintenance costs**: Increase with age
- **Larger down payment**: Typically needed

## Leasing: Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **Lower monthly payments**: 30-60% less
- **New car every 2-3 years**: Latest features
- **Warranty coverage**: Usually covered entire lease
- **No resale hassle**: Just return it
- **Lower down payment**: Often minimal

### Disadvantages
- **No ownership**: Always have a payment
- **Mileage restrictions**: Overage fees apply
- **Wear and tear charges**: Can add up
- **Early termination fees**: Expensive to exit
- **Can't customize**: Must return as-is

## Cost Comparison Example

$40,000 vehicle over 6 years:

### Buying (60-month loan)
- Down payment: $4,000
- Monthly payment: $667
- Total payments: $44,000
- Value after 6 years: ~$15,000
- **Net cost: $29,000**

### Leasing (Two 36-month leases)
- Down payment: $2,000 × 2 = $4,000
- Monthly payment: $400 × 72 = $28,800
- No ownership at end
- **Net cost: $32,800**

*Buying often wins over time, but leasing offers lower short-term costs*

## When to LEASE

- Want a new car every 2-3 years
