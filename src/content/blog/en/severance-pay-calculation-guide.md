## What is Severance Pay?

Severance pay is a form of compensation that employees receive when they leave a company, typically due to layoffs, company restructuring, or retirement. Understanding how severance is calculated can help you plan your finances and ensure you receive what you're entitled to.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about severance pay calculation in 2026.

## Eligibility Requirements

Before calculating your severance, confirm that you meet the basic eligibility requirements:

- **Minimum service period**: Usually 1 year of continuous employment
- **Employment type**: Full-time employees (part-time may have different rules)
- **Termination type**: Involuntary termination, layoffs, or retirement

### Important Notes

Employees who voluntarily resign may not be entitled to statutory severance pay, though company policies may differ. Always check your employment contract and local regulations.

## Severance Pay Calculation Formula

The standard formula for calculating severance pay is:

**Severance Pay = Average Daily Wage × 30 × Years of Service**

### Calculating Average Daily Wage

Average daily wage = Total wages for last 3 months ÷ Number of days in that period

**What's included in total wages:**
- Base salary
- Regular allowances
- Bonuses (prorated)
- Overtime pay

## Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's walk through a practical example:

**Scenario**: $5,000 monthly salary, 5 years of service

1. **Calculate 3-month total wages**: $5,000 × 3 = $15,000
2. **Calculate average daily wage**: $15,000 ÷ 90 days = $166.67
3. **Calculate severance**: $166.67 × 30 × 5 years = **$25,000**

## Tax Considerations

Severance pay is subject to taxation, but often at preferential rates:

### Common Tax Benefits

1. **Service-based deductions**: Longer service often means larger deductions
2. **Averaging provisions**: Some jurisdictions spread the tax over multiple years
3. **Retirement account options**: Rolling severance into retirement accounts may defer taxes

The effective tax rate on severance is typically lower than regular income tax rates.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Watch out for these frequent errors when calculating severance:

1. **Forgetting bonuses**: Annual bonuses should be prorated and included
2. **Wrong service dates**: Include probation periods and leave time
3. **Missing allowances**: Regular allowances are part of your wage calculation
4. **Not checking company policy**: Some companies offer enhanced severance
