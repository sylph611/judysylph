## Age Calculation Basics

Calculating exact age involves more than simple math. Different cultures and contexts use different age systems, and precision can matter for legal and medical purposes.

## How Age is Calculated

### Standard Method
Count complete years from birthdate to current date, then months and days for precision.

### Formula
1. Calculate year difference
2. Adjust for whether birthday has occurred this year
3. Count remaining months and days

## Example Calculation

Birthdate: March 15, 1990
Current date: January 31, 2026

1. Years: 2026 - 1990 = 36
2. Birthday hasn't occurred in 2026 yet
3. Adjusted age: 35 years
4. Months since last birthday: 10 (Mar 15 to Jan 31)
5. Days: 16

**Exact age: 35 years, 10 months, 16 days**

## Age in Different Units

From the example above:
- **Years**: 35.87
- **Months**: 430
- **Weeks**: 1,873
- **Days**: 13,112
- **Hours**: 314,688
- **Minutes**: 18,881,280
- **Seconds**: 1,132,876,800

## Different Age Systems

### International Age
- Starts at 0 at birth
- Increases on each birthday
- Used globally in most contexts

### Korean Age (Traditional)
- Starts at 1 at birth
- Everyone ages on January 1
- 1-2 years older than international age
- Note: Korea officially adopted international age in 2023

### Chinese Age
- Similar to traditional Korean age
- Used in some cultural contexts
