## Why Compare Mortgages?

Even small rate differences significantly impact your total cost. Shopping around can save thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

## Key Comparison Factors

### Interest Rate
The base cost of borrowing. Even 0.25% difference matters:
- $300,000 loan, 30 years
- 6.5% rate: $1,896/month, $382,560 total interest
- 6.25% rate: $1,847/month, $364,920 total interest
- **Savings: $17,640**

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
Includes rate + fees for true cost comparison. Always compare APR alongside rates.

### Closing Costs
Vary significantly between lenders:
- Origination fees: 0-1% of loan
- Third-party fees: $1,500-3,000
- Total: Typically 2-5% of loan

### Points
Prepaid interest to lower your rate:
- 1 point = 1% of loan amount
- Typically reduces rate by 0.25%
- Makes sense if staying long-term
