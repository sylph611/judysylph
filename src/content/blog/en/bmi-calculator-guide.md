faq:
  - question: "How is BMI calculated?"
    answer: "BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared: BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)². For pounds and inches: BMI = (weight × 703) / height²."
  - question: "What is a healthy BMI range?"
    answer: "A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally considered healthy. Below 18.5 is underweight, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30+ is classified as obese."
  - question: "Is BMI accurate for everyone?"
    answer: "BMI has limitations. It doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, age, or fat distribution. Athletes may have high BMI due to muscle, not fat."

## What is BMI?

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using height and weight to estimate body fat and categorize weight status. It's widely used as a screening tool for weight-related health risks.

## BMI Formula

**BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ Height (m)²**

Or in imperial units:
**BMI = (Weight (lbs) × 703) ÷ Height (inches)²**

## BMI Categories

| BMI Range | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| Below 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 - 24.9 | Normal weight |
| 25.0 - 29.9 | Overweight |
| 30.0 - 34.9 | Obese (Class I) |
| 35.0 - 39.9 | Obese (Class II) |
| 40.0+ | Obese (Class III) |

## Example Calculation

Person: 70 kg, 1.75 m tall
- BMI = 70 ÷ (1.75)²
- BMI = 70 ÷ 3.0625
- **BMI = 22.9 (Normal weight)**

## Limitations of BMI

BMI is a useful screening tool but has significant limitations:

### Doesn't Distinguish Fat from Muscle
Athletes with high muscle mass may be classified as overweight despite low body fat.

### Doesn't Show Fat Distribution
Belly fat (visceral fat) is more dangerous than fat in other areas, but BMI doesn't capture this.

### Age and Gender Factors
BMI categories don't account for changes in body composition with age or differences between sexes.

## Better Health Indicators

Consider BMI alongside:
- **Waist circumference**: Risk increases >40" (men) or >35" (women)
- **Waist-to-hip ratio**: Shows fat distribution
- **Body fat percentage**: Direct measure of fat
- **Blood markers**: Cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure

## Conclusion

BMI is a helpful starting point for understanding weight status, but it's just one piece of the health puzzle. Consider multiple factors and consult healthcare providers for a complete picture.
