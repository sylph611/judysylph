## Understanding Salary Percentiles

Salary percentiles show where your income falls relative to others. This context helps you understand your earning power and negotiate better compensation.

## How Percentiles Work

- **10th percentile**: Bottom 10% of earners
- **50th percentile (median)**: Middle earner
- **90th percentile**: Top 10% of earners
- **99th percentile**: Top 1%

### Why Not Use Averages?

Averages are pulled up by extremely high earners. The mean salary is often 15-20% higher than the median, giving a misleading picture.

## US Income Distribution (2026 Estimates)

| Percentile | Individual Income | Household Income |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 10th | ~$20,000 | ~$30,000 |
| 25th | ~$32,000 | ~$45,000 |
| 50th (Median) | ~$57,000 | ~$77,000 |
| 75th | ~$90,000 | ~$130,000 |
| 90th | ~$140,000 | ~$220,000 |
| 95th | ~$200,000 | ~$320,000 |
| 99th | ~$400,000+ | ~$600,000+ |

## Factors Affecting Your Percentile

### Education
Higher degrees correlate with higher earnings:
- High school diploma: ~$42,000 median
- Bachelor's degree: ~$72,000 median
- Master's degree: ~$85,000 median
- Professional degree: ~$120,000+ median

### Industry
Tech, finance, and healthcare typically pay more than retail, hospitality, and education.

### Location
Cost-of-living adjusted salaries vary significantly:
- San Francisco: Higher nominal, similar purchasing power
- Rural areas: Lower nominal, potentially higher purchasing power

### Experience
Earnings typically peak in your 40s-50s after decades of career growth.
