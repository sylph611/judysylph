## Determining Your Car Budget

A car is typically the second-largest purchase after a home. Smart budgeting ensures you get reliable transportation without financial strain.

## The 20/4/10 Rule

A widely recommended guideline:
- **20%** minimum down payment
- **4** years maximum loan term
- **10%** of gross income max for total car costs

### Example

Gross monthly income: $5,000
- Max total car costs: $500/month
- Including: payment, insurance, gas, maintenance

## Affordability Calculation

### Step 1: Determine Monthly Budget
Take 10-15% of gross monthly income.

### Step 2: Subtract Ongoing Costs
- Insurance: $100-200/month
- Gas: $150-300/month
- Maintenance: $50-100/month

### Step 3: Remaining = Max Payment
This is your maximum monthly car payment.

## Financing Options

### Auto Loans
- **Bank/credit union**: Often best rates
- **Dealer financing**: Convenient but compare rates
- **0% financing**: Great if you qualify; read terms carefully

### Loan Term Impact

| Term | Monthly Payment | Total Interest |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| 36 months | Higher | Lowest |
| 48 months | Moderate | Low |
| 60 months | Lower | Moderate |
| 72+ months | Lowest | Highest |

## Total Cost of Ownership

Look beyond the sticker price:

### Depreciation
New cars lose 20-30% in year one. Consider 2-3 year old vehicles.

### Insurance
Rates vary significantly by vehicle. Get quotes before buying.

### Fuel Efficiency
Calculate annual fuel costs based on your driving habits.

### Maintenance & Repairs
Luxury and European cars often cost more to maintain.

## Sample Budget

$60,000 annual income, following 20/4/10:
- Monthly car budget: $500
- Less insurance: $150
- Less gas: $150
- Less maintenance: $50
- **Max payment: $150/month**
- **Affordable car: ~$6,500**

*This may seem low, which shows why many people overspend on cars!*
