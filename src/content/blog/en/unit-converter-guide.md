  - question: "What is the difference between metric and imperial?"
    answer: "Metric uses base-10 units (meters, grams, liters). Imperial uses traditional units (feet, pounds, gallons). Most countries use metric; US primarily uses imperial."
  - question: "How do I convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?"
    answer: "Multiply by 9/5 and add 32. Formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32. Example: 20°C = (20 × 1.8) + 32 = 68°F."
  - question: "What's the difference between mass and weight?"
    answer: "Mass is the amount of matter (same everywhere). Weight is the force of gravity on mass (varies by location). On Earth, they're often used interchangeably."

| Cups | Liters | 0.2366 |
| Gallons (US) | Liters | 3.785 |
| Quarts | Liters | 0.946 |

### Temperature
- **°C to °F**: (°C × 9/5) + 32
- **°F to °C**: (°F - 32) × 5/9
- **°C to K**: °C + 273.15

## Quick Mental Conversions

### Approximate Rules
- **Km to Miles**: Multiply by 0.6 (or divide by 1.6)
- **Kg to Pounds**: Multiply by 2.2
- **Liters to Gallons**: Divide by 4 (roughly)
- **Cm to Inches**: Divide by 2.5

### Temperature Shortcuts
- 0°C = 32°F (freezing)
- 20°C ≈ 68°F (room temp)
- 37°C ≈ 98.6°F (body temp)
- 100°C = 212°F (boiling)

## Metric Prefixes

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Kilo | k | 1,000 |
| Hecto | h | 100 |
| Deca | da | 10 |
| Base | - | 1 |
| Deci | d | 0.1 |
| Centi | c | 0.01 |
| Milli | m | 0.001 |

## Area and Volume

### Area
- 1 square foot = 0.0929 m²
- 1 acre = 4,047 m² = 0.4047 hectares
- 1 square mile = 2.59 km²

### Volume (Cooking)
- 1 teaspoon = 5 ml
- 1 tablespoon = 15 ml = 3 teaspoons
- 1 cup = 240 ml (US)
- 1 cup = 250 ml (metric)

## Speed
