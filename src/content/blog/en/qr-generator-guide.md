## What is a QR Code?

QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that store information readable by smartphone cameras. Invented in 1994 for tracking automotive parts, they're now ubiquitous for sharing information quickly.

## Types of QR Codes

### Static QR Codes
- Data encoded directly
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Work forever (never expire)
- Free to create

### Dynamic QR Codes
- Point to a redirect URL
- Can be updated anytime
- Track scan analytics
- Usually require subscription

## Common QR Code Uses

### URLs
Share website links instantly:
`https://example.com/page`

### WiFi
Connect devices without typing passwords:
`WIFI:T:WPA;S:NetworkName;P:Password;;`

### Contact Cards (vCard)
Share contact information:
`BEGIN:VCARD...`

### Email
Pre-filled email composition:
`mailto:email@example.com?subject=Hello`

### Phone

## QR Code Best Practices
