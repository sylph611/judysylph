faq:
  - question: "Is buying always better than renting?"
    answer: "No. Buying makes sense if you'll stay 5+ years, have stable income, and the buy-to-rent ratio is favorable. Renting offers flexibility and avoids maintenance costs."
  - question: "What is the price-to-rent ratio?"
    answer: "Divide home price by annual rent. Under 15 favors buying; 16-20 is neutral; over 21 favors renting. Example: $400,000 home / $24,000 rent = 16.7 (neutral)."
  - question: "What hidden costs does buying have?"
    answer: "Property taxes, insurance, maintenance (1-2% of value annually), HOA fees, closing costs, and opportunity cost of down payment."

## The Rent vs Buy Decision

Choosing between renting and buying is one of the biggest financial decisions you'll make. Both options have distinct advantages depending on your situation.

## Advantages of Buying

- **Building equity**: Payments reduce your loan and build wealth
- **Stable payments**: Fixed-rate mortgages don't increase
- **Tax benefits**: Mortgage interest and property tax deductions
- **Freedom**: Modify your home as you wish
- **Forced savings**: Equity accumulates automatically

## Advantages of Renting

- **Flexibility**: Move easily for jobs or lifestyle
- **Predictable costs**: No surprise repairs
- **Lower upfront costs**: No down payment or closing costs
- **Investment opportunity**: Invest down payment elsewhere
- **No market risk**: Home values don't affect you

## Price-to-Rent Ratio

**Ratio = Home Price ÷ Annual Rent**

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| Under 15 | Buying is likely better |
| 15-20 | Roughly equal |
| Over 20 | Renting is likely better |

### Example
Home: $450,000
Monthly rent for similar home: $2,200
Annual rent: $26,400
Ratio: 450,000 ÷ 26,400 = **17** (neutral)

## True Cost of Owning

Beyond your mortgage payment:

### Monthly Costs
- Principal & interest
- Property taxes (~1-2% annually)
- Homeowners insurance
- PMI (if < 20% down)
- HOA fees
- Maintenance reserves

### One-Time Costs
- Down payment (5-20%)
- Closing costs (2-5%)
- Moving expenses
- Initial repairs/updates

## True Cost of Renting

- Monthly rent
- Renters insurance
- Annual rent increases (3-5% typical)
- Moving costs if relocating

## Break-Even Timeline

Generally, buying becomes advantageous after **5-7 years** due to:
- Closing costs being amortized
- Equity building up
- Appreciation (historically ~3-4% annually)

## Decision Framework

**Lean toward BUYING if:**
- Staying 5+ years
- Stable income and career
- Good credit (720+)
- 10-20% down payment saved
- Buy-to-rent ratio under 20
- Ready for homeowner responsibilities

**Lean toward RENTING if:**
- Uncertain about location
- Career may require moves
- Saving for down payment
- High-cost housing market
- Prefer maintenance-free living
