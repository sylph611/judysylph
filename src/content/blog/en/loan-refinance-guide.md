## Understanding Refinancing

Refinancing replaces your existing loan with a new one, ideally with better terms. It can lower your monthly payment, reduce total interest, or help you access equity.

## Reasons to Refinance

### Lower Interest Rate
Even a 0.5% rate reduction can save thousands over the loan term.

### Change Loan Term
- **Shorten term**: Pay off faster, less total interest
- **Lengthen term**: Lower monthly payments

### Switch Loan Type
- ARM to fixed rate: Stability
- Fixed to ARM: Lower initial rate

### Cash-Out Refinance
Access home equity for major expenses, debt consolidation, or investments.

## The Break-Even Calculation

**Break-Even Months = Closing Costs ÷ Monthly Savings**

### Example
- Closing costs: $6,000
- Monthly savings: $200
- Break-even: 30 months

If you'll stay longer than 30 months, refinancing makes sense.

## Refinancing Costs

| Fee | Typical Amount |
|-----|----------------|
| Application fee | $250-500 |
| Appraisal | $400-700 |
| Title search | $200-400 |
| Title insurance | $500-1,500 |
| Origination fee | 0.5-1% of loan |
| Total | 2-5% of loan |

## Example: Refinance Savings

Current: $300,000 at 7%, 25 years remaining
New: $300,000 at 5.5%, 25 years

- Old payment: $2,121/month
- New payment: $1,840/month
- Monthly savings: $281
- Closing costs: $9,000
- Break-even: 32 months
- **25-year savings: $75,000+**

## When NOT to Refinance

- Moving soon (before break-even)
- Credit score has dropped significantly
- Taking cash out to fund lifestyle expenses
- Resetting a nearly paid-off mortgage

## The Refinancing Process

1. Check your credit score
2. Gather financial documents
3. Shop multiple lenders
4. Lock your rate
5. Complete appraisal
6. Review and sign closing documents
