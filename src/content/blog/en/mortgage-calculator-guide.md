## Understanding Mortgages

A mortgage is a loan used to purchase real estate, secured by the property itself. Understanding how mortgages work helps you make informed decisions about the biggest purchase most people ever make.

## Mortgage Payment Formula

**M = P × [r(1+r)ⁿ] / [(1+r)ⁿ - 1]**

Where:
- M = Monthly payment
- P = Principal (loan amount)
- r = Monthly interest rate
- n = Total number of payments

## Components of Monthly Payment (PITI)

- **Principal**: Portion that reduces your loan balance
- **Interest**: Cost of borrowing money
- **Taxes**: Property taxes (varies by location)
- **Insurance**: Homeowners insurance and PMI if applicable

## Example Calculation

$400,000 home, 20% down, 6.5% rate, 30-year term:

1. Loan amount: $320,000
2. Monthly P&I: $2,022
3. Estimated taxes: $400
4. Insurance: $150
5. **Total monthly: ~$2,572**

## Loan Term Comparison

| | 15-Year | 30-Year |
|--|---------|---------|
| Monthly Payment | Higher | Lower |
| Interest Rate | Lower | Higher |
| Total Interest Paid | Less | More |
| Builds Equity | Faster | Slower |

### $300,000 Loan at 6.5% vs 6.0%

- 15-year: $2,613/month, $170,000 total interest
- 30-year: $1,896/month, $382,000 total interest

## Down Payment Impact

- **20%+ down**: No PMI required
- **10-19% down**: PMI until 20% equity
- **3-5% down**: Higher PMI, more interest over time

## Tips for Better Rates

1. Improve credit score (aim for 740+)
2. Save larger down payment
3. Compare multiple lenders
4. Consider buying points
5. Choose shorter loan term
