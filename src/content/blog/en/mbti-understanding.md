## What is MBTI?

MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is a personality assessment tool developed by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers, based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types.

## The 4 Preference Pairs

### 1. Energy Direction (E vs I)

- **Extraversion (E)**: Energized by the outer world
- **Introversion (I)**: Energized by the inner world

### 2. Perception Function (S vs N)

- **Sensing (S)**: Prefers concrete, practical information
- **Intuition (N)**: Focuses on patterns and possibilities

### 3. Judging Function (T vs F)

- **Thinking (T)**: Makes decisions based on logic
- **Feeling (F)**: Values harmony and relationships

### 4. Lifestyle (J vs P)

- **Judging (J)**: Prefers planned, organized life
- **Perceiving (P)**: Prefers flexible, spontaneous life

## Tips for Using MBTI

- MBTI shows **preferences**, not absolute categories
- Use it as a **tool** for self and others understanding
- Don't be **limited** by your type - find directions for growth
