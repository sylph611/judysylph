## Understanding Annual Leave

Annual leave, also known as vacation time or paid time off (PTO), is paid time away from work that employees accrue over time. It's a fundamental employee benefit that supports work-life balance.

## Annual Leave Accrual Methods

### Per Pay Period Accrual

Most common method where leave accumulates each pay period:
- Bi-weekly: Total days ÷ 26 pay periods
- Monthly: Total days ÷ 12 months

### Front-Loading

Some companies provide the full annual allotment at the start of the year.

## Standard Accrual Rates

| Years of Service | Typical Days/Year |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0-1 years | 10-15 days |
| 2-5 years | 15-20 days |
| 5+ years | 20-25 days |

## Calculating Vacation Pay

**Daily Rate = Annual Salary ÷ Working Days per Year**

**Vacation Payout = Daily Rate × Unused Days**

### Example

Salary: $60,000/year, 10 unused days:
1. Daily rate: $60,000 ÷ 260 = $230.77
2. **Payout: $230.77 × 10 = $2,307.70**

## Carryover Policies

Common approaches to unused leave:

- **Use-it-or-lose-it**: Days expire at year end
- **Limited carryover**: Cap on days carried forward
- **Unlimited carryover**: Days accumulate indefinitely
- **Payout option**: Cash out unused days

## Legal Requirements

Annual leave regulations vary by country:

- **USA**: No federal mandate; employer discretion
- **UK**: Minimum 28 days (including public holidays)
- **EU**: Minimum 20 working days
- **Australia**: Minimum 20 days
